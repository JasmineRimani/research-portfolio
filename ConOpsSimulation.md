## 🚀 Summary

Autonomous systems are crucial for planetary exploration, yet their **operational behavior** is often hard to evaluate early in the design phase. Traditional Concept of Operations (ConOps) approaches often overlook **dynamic interactions** between system behavior, resources, and mission goals.

This study introduces a **simulation-backed framework** that helps **validate and refine operational scenarios** during the conceptual and preliminary design of autonomous robotic systems—*before hardware even exists*.

---

## 🧭 Motivation

Designing autonomous systems involves major systems engineering challenges:

- ✍️ Writing realistic and flexible **requirements**  
- 🔌 Managing **interfaces** between hardware, software, and human operators  
- ✅ Ensuring **verification & validation (V&V)** of system behavior  

Standard ConOps approaches are limited when autonomy increases. They often assume static behavior and ignore context-driven decision-making. This framework closes that gap by simulating how a system **reacts to its environment**, plans missions, and consumes resources.

## 🧱 Framework Architecture

### 1. **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)**
- Serves as the knowledge base for the system’s physical and functional architecture  
- Stores all mission scenarios, operations, constraints, and resources  

### 2. **Simulation Engine using MDP + MCTS**
- **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** defines decision space  
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** solves for near-optimal operational timelines  
- Output: A feasible plan maximizing **scientific return** under **resource constraints**

### 3. **Scenario Execution & Visualization**
- Tracks **step-wise changes** in:
  - Power usage
  - Data storage
  - Mission time  
- Validates design against mission goals

## 🤖 Case Study: Lunar Surface Rover

- ⚖️ Mass: 30 kg  
- 🔋 Power: ~100 W (with recharging)  
- 🎯 Goal: Visit and sample high-value waypoints  
- 🧠 Decision-making is handled by the framework based on resource usage and mission utility

---

## 🧪 Key Contributions

- ✅ Simulates operational behavior **during early design**, not just post-deployment  
- 🧩 Captures tight integration of autonomy, physical systems, and mission goals  
- 🧠 Provides traceable, explainable planning logic using **MBSE + MDP**  
- 🔁 Enables **reusability and modularity** across mission designs

---

## 🔬 Applications

- 🚀 Conceptual design of autonomous rovers, landers, and orbiters  
- 🛠️ Trade-space exploration and architecture validation  
- 📊 Ground control planning with **first-pass operational timelines**  
- 🔁 Scenario testing with simulated faults and rule changes

## 🎯 Future Work

- 🔄 Introduce **multi-agent collaboration** for distributed systems  
- 🧠 Couple MCTS with **neural networks** for faster and deeper planning  
- 🎮 Add support for **mixed-initiative** operation (human + AI co-planning)  
- 📚 Connect with a technology database for **trade-space optimization**

> The framework aims to be part of an interactive toolchain where AI and human operators **co-develop mission timelines and architecture choices**.
