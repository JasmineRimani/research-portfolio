## üß≠ Mission Context

As space agencies plan sustained lunar presence, **lunar lava tubes**‚Äînatural underground tunnels formed by ancient volcanic activity‚Äîhave emerged as prime candidates for future outposts. They offer:
- üå°Ô∏è Thermal insulation  
- üõ°Ô∏è Protection from radiation, micrometeoroids, and regolith  
- üî¨ A pristine environment for scientific study  

But accessing and navigating these caves requires mobility systems capable of overcoming rugged terrain and communication blackouts.

## üöÄ Overview of the Study

This paper presents a **preliminary design** for a robotic *cave explorer* targeting lunar lava tubes, combining:
- **Conceptual systems engineering**
- **Parametric mass and power estimation**
- **Control performance analysis under design variations**

> The novelty lies in the **tight coupling of design feasibility and adaptive control capability**‚Äîassessing whether mobility and GNC systems can remain effective under mass/inertia fluctuations as the design evolves.

## ü§ñ Key Features of the Lunar Hopper

### üîÅ Hybrid Mobility System
- **Wheels + Thrusters** for dual-mode terrain traversal:
  - Wheels for efficiency on flat basaltic terrain
  - Thrusters for semi-ballistic hops over large obstacles

### üß† Autonomy Level
- Targeting **ECSS E3-level autonomy** (adaptive onboard decision-making)
- Required due to limited Earth communication in subsurface environments

### ‚öôÔ∏è Control Approach
- **Baseline PID controller** enhanced with:
  - **MRAC (Model Reference Adaptive Control)** to dynamically adjust to mass variations
- Enables GNC performance assessment *early in the design lifecycle*

## üìê Contributions to Space Systems Design

### ‚úÖ Mission Architecture & Stakeholder Mapping
- Identification of user needs, mission goals, and operational constraints

### üßÆ Preliminary Design Box
- Parametric estimation of:
  - Mass
  - Power consumption
  - System layout
- Provides an initial **feasibility boundary** for future iterations

### üéØ Control-Driven Design Constraints
- GNC hardware (sensors & actuators) defines the **performance envelope** for mass variation
- PID+MRAC control helps estimate **safe mass growth margins** without redesign

## üîÅ Why This Matters

Most studies treat **guidance and control** as an optimization *after* design freeze.  
This work flips that logic:

> **What if we use GNC performance to *shape* the design itself from the start?**

This approach:
- Enables **earlier design validation**
- Reduces redesign risk
- Facilitates **in-flight certification**
- Prepares the system for autonomous adaptability in unknown environments

---

## üîç Future Work

- Extend MRAC controller with **robust or optimal control** strategies
- Broader **Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO)** integration
- Explore **flexible GNC architectures** that evolve with system parameters
- Include full mission simulations in lunar cave analog environments
